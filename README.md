# Neet Protocol
Suppose you want something more challenging than just basing off Neeter's official code or want to develop a server in another language. In that case, this repository will show you everything you need to know to make it compatible with all Neeter clients and guide you through the protocol's structure. Excited? Coming Soon!™️
